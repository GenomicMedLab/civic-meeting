# CIViC Variant Curation Jamboree and Hackathon
## Advancing Cancer Precision Medicine with Community Collaboration

This repository is being used to organize pre-meeting suggestions for the CIViC Variation Curation Jamboree and Hackathon, taking place after the NGS in Molecular Pathology Symposium. Hosted at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, December 1-2, 2016, the Jamboree/Hackathon will focus on further development of CIViC, an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer.

## Variant Curation Jamboree

Molecular biologists, Pathologists and Oncologists (certified or in training), and genome scientists interested in the problem of sequence variant interpretation for cancer precision medicine should submit topics for the **Curation**. To propose a curation topic, visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/genome/civic-meeting/issues).
