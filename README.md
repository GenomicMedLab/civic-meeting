# Cancer Variant Interpretation Hackathon and Curation Jamboree
## Advancing Cancer Precision Medicine with Community Collaboration

This repository is being used to organize pre-meeting suggestions for the CIViC Variation Curation Jamboree and Hackathon, taking place before the CGC annual meeting. Hosted at Washington University in St. Louis, July 30th, 2022, the Jamboree/Hackathon will focus on further development of CIViC and CCGA, community-driven web resources for clinical interpretations of variants in cancer.

## Variant Curation Jamboree

Molecular biologists, Pathologists and Oncologists (certified or in training), and genome scientists interested in the problem of sequence variant interpretation for cancer precision medicine should submit topics for the **Curation**. To propose a curation topic, visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/genome/civic-meeting/issues). 

1. Select **New Issue**
2. Create a title and description for your issue
3. Choose the **Curation** label for your issue

## Hackathon
Software developers, engineers and computational biologists interested in learning and applying back- and front-end web development skills should submit topics for the **Hackathon**. For a quick-start guide on developing for CIViC, see [the civic-server wiki](https://github.com/genome/civic-server/wiki/Getting-Started-with-CIViC-Development-on-AWS). To propose a hackathon topic, visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/genome/civic-meeting/issues).
