# CIViC Variant Curation Jamboree and Hackathon
## Advancing Cancer Precision Medicine with Community Collaboration

This repository is being used to organize pre-meeting suggestions for the CIViC Variation Curation Jamboree and Hackathon, taking place before the ASHG annual meeting. Hosted at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, October 10-11, 2018, the Jamboree/Hackathon will focus on further development of CIViC, an open access, open source, community-driven web resource for Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer.

## Variant Curation Jamboree

Molecular biologists, Pathologists and Oncologists (certified or in training), and genome scientists interested in the problem of sequence variant interpretation for cancer precision medicine should submit topics for the **Curation**. To propose a curation topic, visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/genome/civic-meeting/issues). 

1. Select **New Issue**
2. Create a title and description for your issue
3. Choose the **Curation** label for your issue

## Hackathon
Software developers, engineers and computational biologists interested in learning and applying back- and front-end web development skills should submit topics for the **Hackathon**. For a quick-start guide on developing for CIViC, see [the civic-server wiki](https://github.com/genome/civic-server/wiki/Getting-Started-with-CIViC-Development-on-AWS). To propose a hackathon topic, visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/genome/civic-meeting/issues).

### Git repositories related to the CIViC project
The CIViC source code and application are organized in a client-server model. The backend code is available in the [civic-server repository](https://github.com/genome/civic-server) and frontend code is available in the [civic-client repository](https://github.com/genome/civic-client). Issues relating to curation are tracked in the [civic-curation repository](https://github.com/genome/civic-curation). An example of a Python client is available in the [civic-api-client repository](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-api-client). Issues relating to public CIViC meetings are tracked in the [civic-meeting repository](https://github.com/genome/civic-meeting).
