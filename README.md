# Cancer Variant Interpretation Hackathon and Curation Jamboree
## Advancing Cancer Precision Medicine with Community Collaboration

This repository is being used to organize pre-meeting suggestions for the CIViC Variation Curation Jamboree and Hackathon, taking place before the CGC annual meeting. Hosted at Washington University in St. Louis, July 30th, 2022, the Jamboree/Hackathon will focus on further development of CIViC and CCGA, community-driven web resources for clinical interpretations of variants in cancer.

### Git repositories related to the CIViC project
The CIViC source code and application are organized in a client-server model. The source code for both the [client](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-v2/tree/main/client) and [server](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-v2/tree/main/server) is maintained in the [civic-v2 repository](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-v2). Issues relating to curation are tracked in the [civic-curation repository](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-curation). An example of a Python client is available in the [civic-api-client repository](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-api-client). Issues relating to public CIViC meetings are tracked in the [civic-meeting repository](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-meeting).
